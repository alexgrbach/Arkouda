# Arko√∫da

The Arko√∫da is a 75% Alice-like keyboard.  
It's a fork of floookay's ùï¨ùñâùñäùñëùñçùñäùñéùñâ files: [Repo](https://github.com/floookay/adelheid)

## Changes in this fork

Here is a list of things I added in this fork in comparison to the Arisu:

- [x] Tightend up spacing of keys
- [x] Added super and additonal keys.

## Layout

A compact 75% layout on top of the Alice/Arisu-layout.

## Miscellaneous

> Why?

I think accessing the function keys with a layer on the number row is the superior method as it's faster and more comfortable because you barely have to move your hands. I found myself trying to access the function row one-handedly quite often and nothing beats the comfort of pressing a single dedicated key. By default you can still access the function keys via the number row on the secondary layer.

> Where does the name Arko√∫da come from?

I thought it'd be nice to continue the somewhat tradition of naming Alice-clones by putting a spin on the forename Alice, just like the Arisu, Lisa, Majbritt, and floorkey did. However I am not as clever as the other authors so instead I chose Arko√∫da greek for bear to start a new tradition of names that start with A.
